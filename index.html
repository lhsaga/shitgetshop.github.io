<p>I am sending you this email to inform you that we have shut down the ibedcity due to bad business etics hereby under the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Destroying a lock and trying to claim it by warranty</li>
<li>Posting videos on youtube that might effect our reputation.</li>
<li>Not paying any bills, finding reasons for posponing the bills. Even if the first one was paid under the same curium stances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to this we have decided to end all systems for as of today.</p>
<p>Regarding the locks, you can still use this locks using a home controller like z-wave.me, homeseer, or any other z-wave controller thus they can still be used.</p>
<p>Will also inform you that you are resposible for paying the bills, the latest exuse about not paying due to incorrect name is a new excuse which we have never heard from you before.</p>
<p>We regards this mather as closed and will credit all the invoices instead of spending time trying to collect them.</p>

<h2 id="The-reply-by-Ibedcity"><a href="#The-reply-by-Ibedcity" class="headerlink" title="The reply by Ibedcity"></a>The reply by Ibedcity</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your email. This reply just show the your company culture that how to deal with your customers as always, no surprise.<br>First I will answer your three questions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Destroying a lock and trying to claim it by warranty<br>When we installed the locks because of the lock having so many problems you asked us to disassemble the locks and fix them by ourselves. When the lock had problem again we disassemble it and found out can not fix it, then you blame us to destroy the locks. Please tell me why we want destroy a good locker and what a new back? Do you think it is really fun to all the time install and uninstall the lockers from the door? Our customers have been complaint about those lockers hundreds times. The buttons not working, the handle not working, even one time customer has been locked in the room and the handle dose not working at all, we have to uninstall the whole locker to let the customers out. There is so many good quality lockers in China you can choose but I think you choose the cheapest option as your company vision.<br>Following link is your locker price that sell in Europe 68€. Of course you drilled a hole in the lock so it cost 225€ from you. This is the cheapest digital locker that I can find from following web.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lightinthebox.com/en/p/s200mf-stainless-steel-intelligent-lock-smart-home-security-system-rfid-password-unlocking-mechanical-key-unlocking-bedroom-apartment-hotel-security_p7545064.html?category_id=5084&amp;prm=1.3.70.0">https://www.lightinthebox.com/en/p/s200mf-stainless-steel-intelligent-lock-smart-home-security-system-rfid-password-unlocking-mechanical-key-unlocking-bedroom-apartment-hotel-security_p7545064.html?category_id=5084&amp;prm=1.3.70.0</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Posting videos on youtube that might effect our reputation.<br>Your booking system has so many bugs and we have to use the tickets that means it cost us to report that bugs for you. You really created a great new model of business. You will earn more money if we make more fault report of your system. That make me understand why have to keep booking system have problem all the time. That why encourage us to use the “help” tickets all the time. Brilliant idea!!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not paying any bills, finding reasons for posponing the bills. Even if the first one was paid under the same curium stances.<br>We sign the contract with our company name, and you send the bill with other company’s name. If I am the person know that I will 100% understand that it is normal for your company this kind of mistake. Unfortunately our bookkeeper do not understand and our new stuff do not know that. If the customer did not complaint at the beginning when you make the mistake it is does not mean the customer should accept it next time when you make the same mistake, that what I understand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I have some questions for you.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You told us that you have the most advanced locker system in the world, customer can check in and check out with one code to go to the main door and the door of their own room. We believed you and bought it . After we installed it you told us the main door code can not be same code as room anymore because we have too many room(8 rooms) or beds(50 beds)? Your solution to us is main door keep the same code number and room code can change. That means the main door code always been the same, the guests whoever know the main door code can come back as many times as they want. This is not the way your promised at the beginning. One of our guest left a comment about your locker system on the google I think, he said he forgot something in the room, after one week when he turn back he just use the same code opened all the doors- main door and room door that code set by you. He said that our hostel not safe. What is your opinion for this case?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because of the mistake you have made, like send the wrong side of lockers even we double checked before you send them. Some lockers has faults and some parts you forgot to send us. Forgot to ask the delivery company to pick up the lockers etc. Those case us lots of time to make this most advanced system. What is your opinion for those time delay, but we still have to pay for the system time even the lockers are not ready yet?</p>
</li>
<li><p>You connect all the channels for us. We been told that we just change the price from your system that all the channels will change automatically. We found out some channels did not changed the price and it makes us lose much income during the high season. I would like to know who is responsible for this case?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end I have to say it is glad that you shut this system down for us. We do not need struggling for this trouble system anymore. A company that care the income most and care the customer least I do not think will go far. What we do next is share our experience with others, help they make wise decision.</p>
